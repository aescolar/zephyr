	  When this option is set the natsim board will pretend to be
	  a native_posix board from kconfig point of view, to allow using it directly with
	  code which was meant for the native_posix board and checks for the macro
	  CONFIG_BOARD_NATIVE_POSIX, or requires other kconfig options which depend on it.

	help
	  When selected the execution of the process will be slowed down to real time.
	  (if there is a lot of load it may be slower than real time)
	  If deselected, the process will run as fast as possible.
	  Note that this only decouples simulated time from real/wall time. In either
	  case the zephyr kernel and application cannot tell the difference unless they
	  interact with some other driver/device which runs at real time.

	  Transitional option which allows applications which targetted native_posix
	  to set the correct natsim option (CONFIG_NATSIM_SLOWDOWN_TO_REAL_TIME)
