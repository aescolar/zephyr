- Decide if runner is own repo (or even replica)
  -> star in linux_embedded_runner/ folder
~- Decide if runner is bsim component~ <- No due to expected resistance from Zephyr to adopt
- Decide on build of runner itself, and postlink:
  ->  Start w make (easy for me), most likely a demand for cmake will follow

 (done) * Create CPU_#N_ hooks
 (done) * Initial refactor board code

------------

 (done) * Test gprof (done)

 (done) * Â¿Move arch core and soc core to LER? (done initial)
 
 * More proper refactor of board/ler code
   * includes in src/include to be only what is really public, everything else into private headers

 ~* Host trampolines~
 ~  Their purpose is to enable linking to the right symbols, even if other ones exist in the embedded environment~
 ~** For simple/basic APIs (no host headers includes thru (or only those expected in freestanding environments)~
 ~** For complex APIs (w host headers includes thru)~
 ~   Will require the integrator to include the stdincludes when building that libary in the embedded environment
 ~   (but saves the integrator from needing to split that library into another build)

 * Test with embedded C library, and POSIX API

* Kconfig
 (done) * New: NATIVE_LIBRARY
 ->  * Could also add a general BUILD_OUTPUT_LIBRARY (selected by NATIVE_LIBRARY)
 (done) * New: NATIVE_BUILD (common to NATIVE_LIBRARY and NATIVE_APPLICATION)
 (done) * Both NATIVE_LIBRARY and NATIVE_APPLICATION imply NATIVE_BUILD
 -> * Piggy back on COMPILER_FREESTANDING
 ~* New: NATIVE_MONOLITIC_APP (for native_posix and old bsim board)~
 ~* Change libC options to allow building embedded libC with NATIVE_LIBRARY~
 ~* Both NATIVE_LIBRARY and NATIVE_MONOLITIC_APP imply NATIVE_APPLICATION~

 (done) * LER_CPU_INDEX (which CPU number is this Zephyr build targetting)

 * Add kconfig options for LER instead of piggybacking on native_posix

 * Test embedded libC on linux runner
 * Test POSIX API shim on linux runner

(done)* Move LINUX_RUNNER_IF to basic header
  ~Maybe define a Processor interface macro (exactly the same content as LINUX_RUNNER_IF)~
* ReName zephyr.elf to something like cpu_#n.sw.o (thru Kconfig)

* Fix DT gen_handles input issue

* Document overall way of working
* Properly document interfaces (headers) between board and runner

* Polish cmake code
* Polish board code
* Clean up kconfig
* Polish linux runner code
* posix arch bottom (lct) cleanup old comments & comment

* Handle build of runner and common link for multicore thru sysbuild

~* Generalize for LER_N_CPUs > 1~

* Check COMPILER_SECURITY_FORTIFY (if it can be enabled)

* Polish for clang / support out of the box
