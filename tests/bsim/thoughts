Each test .sh has a
	#Requires: tests_bsim_bluetooth_audio_prj_conf

Each app that can be built has its own compile script
compile.tests_bsim_bluetooth_audio_prj_conf.sh

We find all cases to run
We grep all "#Requires: " lines
We remove the "#Requires: " and strip spaces
We sort and unique them
For each line we find the compile.${LINE}.sh:
	convert all list into a set of (*3)
		-o -name "compile.${LINE}.sh"
We run in parallel all those compile scripts

*3
A=("a" "b" "c")
for el in ${A[@]}; do echo $el ; done | awk 'NR > 1 {printf("-o ")}; {print "-name", $0".compile"}' | xargs -I {} echo {}

  | awk 'NR > 1 {printf("-o ")}; {print "-name", compile.$0".sh"}' | xargs find ${ZEPHYR_BASE}/tests/bsim/
